Cerebellum and Frontal Lobe Segmentation Based on K-Means Clustering and Morphological Transformation described in [our paper at iSemantic2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234262). Please kindly cite the following paper when you use this tool. It would also be appreciated if you send me a courtesy [website](http://rakha.asyrofi.com/) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WN9T5UUAAAAJ&hl=id&oi=ao), so I could survey what kind of tasks the tool is used for.
